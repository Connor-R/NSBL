# NSBL
This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

This repo primarily contains a set of python scripts for building and updating my personal MySQL db for the NSBL simulation league ([thensbl.com](http://thensbl.com)).

The scripts in the directory `mlb_prospects` are used for scraping the mlb.com prospect lists.

A full backup of the database (.csv and SQL format) can be found from the following link [http://bit.ly/NSBL_db_backups](http://bit.ly/NSBL_db_backups).
