This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.

This repo primarily contains a set of python scripts for building and updating my personal MySQL db for the NSBL simulation league ([thensbl.com](http://thensbl.com)).

A full backup of the database (.csv and SQL format) can be found from the following link [https://www.dropbox.com/s/0by593fy974kkz3/NSBL.sql?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0by593fy974kkz3/NSBL.sql?dl=0).
